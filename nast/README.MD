# WTF IS NAST???????
There is an AST - an Abstract Syntax Tree. But this is actually a NAST - a Not Abstract Syntax Tree.
Essentially, it serves the same purpose as an AST, but because Brainfuck has no control flow (no if/else/switch), what we get here is a linked list of nodes. Therefore, it's not an abstract syntax tree.
Got it? NAST :)
